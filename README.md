# 42-fillit

Fillit is a project which involves discovering and getting acquainted with a recurrent problem in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities in a reasonable amount of time. In this project, you will arrange Tetriminos among them and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them.


# Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/avocadohooman/42-fillit.git | cd 42-fillit
make
make clean
./fillit [] source_file e.g. ./fillit tetris_blocks/valid_4t.txt
```

# Notes by the Creator
The algorithm used for this project is pretty effective and fast up until 10 pieces. The more pieces, and the more complicated the combinations the slower it gets.

For future developments:
- Improve efficency and speed for more than 10 pieces.
